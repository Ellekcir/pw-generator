# Password Generator

## Description

As we all know the web is full of hackers so this project was created to assist making secure passwords. The page randomises a selection of characters chosen by the user ensuring to recieve hopefully a more secure password. The User has the options to choose from a variety of selections to add more security and is alerted when it doesn't meet the criteria. I learnt alot this project, creating such a large function for the arrays to be used at random, has shown me the power of what even the basic javascript really has. I struggled to get the arrays to join or to push, so it resulted me in using the concat method which I found a lot more easier to use. Using the for loop has also taken me some time to get my head around but I have used it for the User input to loop the function for the amount of characters desired for the password.
